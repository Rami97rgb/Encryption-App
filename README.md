# Encryption-App
Built a C++ app that can encrypt or decrypt inputed text and that implements multiple encryption algorithms: AES, RSA, Vigenere, Che, Caesar, and Rot13.

## AES Encryption
To use AES algorithm:
1. Run the program in AES folder.
2. Input message to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter an encryption key of size 128, 192, or 256 bits meaning 16, 24, or 32 characters.
4. Choose to encrypt or decrypt: type "e" or "d".

## RSA Encryption
To use RSA algorithm:
1. Run the program in RSA folder.
2. Choose to generate keys, encrypt, or decrypt: type "g", "e", or "d".
3. If genrating keys enter two distincts prime numbers and select a pair of public key and private key.
4. If encrypting enter the message and type the two prime numbers and the public key.
5. If decrypting enter the message and type the two prime numbers and the private key.

## Vigenere Encryption
To use Vigenere algorithm:
1. Run the program in Vigenere folder.
2. Input message to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Choose to encrypt or decrypt: type "e" or "d".
4. Enter an encryption key, it must be an alphabetic string.

## Che Encryption
To use Che algorithm:
1. Run the program in Che folder.
2. Input message to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Choose to encrypt or decrypt: type "e" or "d".
4. Enter an encryption key, it must be numerical.

## Caesar Encryption
To use Caesar algorithm:
1. Run the program in Caesar folder.
2. Input message to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter an encryption key, it can be any number.
4. Choose to encrypt or decrypt: type "e" or "d".

## Rot13 Encryption
To use Rot13 algorithm:
1. Run the program in Rot13 folder.
2. Input message to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Choose to encrypt or decrypt: type "e" or "d".
